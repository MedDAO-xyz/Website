        So we&apos;ve piqued your interest and now you want to get involved.
        Maybe you&apos;re a healthcare provider and want to truly be part of a
        vision to utilize blockchain technology and shared ownership to better
        share and deliver healthcare knowledge. Maybe you are a patient or
        advocate who wants to take on a more of an active role in how medical
        expertise is shared. Or perhaps, you are just interested in learning
        more about or contributing to the conversation on Web3, blockchain and
        DAOs as they pertain to healthcare.
        <br />
        <br />
